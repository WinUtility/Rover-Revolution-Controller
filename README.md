# Rover-Revolution-Controller
Control your rover revolution from your PC.

You have to manually connect to the rover's WiFi on Windows first.

Implements the features reverse engineered by simondlevy in https://github.com/simondlevy/RoverPylot in a standalone Windows executable.

Supports changing key binds, including joystick.

The rover has some limitations. For example, the audio is glitchy if the Rover isn't 100% still, so volume is defaulted to 0. Steering and speed only support 2 levels. When switching cameras, it takes a while for the rover to load the new camera stream.
